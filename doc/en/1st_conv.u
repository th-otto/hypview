!begin_node General

!begin_center
            1stConv, 1stGuide to ST-Guide hypertext converter (!nl)
                          English release 4
!end_center

Using 1st_Conv it's easy to convert any 1st Guide (Shareware) format
hypertext to ST-Guide format source code ready for compilation using
HCP.

!end_node

!begin_node 1stConv calls

The calling syntax is as follows:

  1stConv [-f -a -q -NNN] file

The file <file> can be simply dragged onto the 1stConv icon (so long
as you're using a desktop (like Gemini) which supports Drag&drop).

Alternatively 1stConv can be installed as an application for files with
the file extension HLP (take care other applications such as compiled
PureC help files also use this extension).

!begin_node Option -f
!alias -f

This option causes the converter to use the filename as the page name.
In this case the concept (word or phrase) used for referencing is used
for the page title and HCP will be configured to include the page
titles instead of the names in the index page.

!end_node

!begin_node Option -a
!alias -a

This option explicitly sets all cross references and sets the HCP
switch to disable automatic cross referencing on compilation.

!end_node

!begin_node Option -q
!alias -q

This option suppresses output apart from error messages.
(i.e. 1stConv runs in 'quiet' mode.

This option is particularly useful when 1stConv output is diverted to a
file listing any syntax errors in the original hypertext.

!end_node


!begin_node Option -NNN
!alias -NNN

With this option one can pre-define roughly how many lines should be
written per output file. If the predefined length is exceeded 1stConv
produces further files that can be linked using '(!XLINK [@include] [hcp] [Command @include])' to the
main text.

!end_node

!end_node

!begin_node Operation

!index Output
!index STG
The converter creates at least one STG format output file from the
input file.
If the number of lines set using the option -NNN is exceeded
further files <file1>, <file2> are created. All output files are
created in the directory containing the input file.

!index PRJ
First of all 1stConv attempts open a .PRJ file. If successful, the
contents of this file are copied to the output file which should
contain the usual header details
(!XLINK [@database] [hcp] [Command @database]), (!XLINK [@author] [hcp] [Command @author]), (!XLINK [@$VER:] [hcp] [Command @$VER:]), (!XLINK [@subject] [hcp] [Command @subject]) etc.
(!link [Study PRJ file now! ] [Example PRJ file])

This feature makes it easy for hypertext authors to maintain their
hypertexts in 1stGuide and ST-Guide format. It's also of interest for
anyone who 'only convert' when a 1stGuide text frequently appears in
new versions, and needs to be converted regularly.

Subsequently all ASCII files referenced from the main text <file> (and
of course any referenced from them etc) will be concentrated
into one file and supplied with the corresponding directives, so that
the output-file created this way only has to be translated with HCP to
obtain an identical hypertext in ST-Guide format.

References to files not found will be output in the form of a warning
message, since this is due to errors in the text as a rule (1stGuide
has no FileFinder so wouldn't find/display the files in question
either).

References to *.IMG images are converted to cross references to
internal pages in which the illustration will then appear.

Cross references to other non-ASCII files (images, RSC-files etc) will
be converted to external references.

!end_node

!begin_node Example PRJ file
!alias PRJ
!index PRJ

An example of a typical PRJ file follows. For our example we're going
to convert the LaTeX Hypertext LATEX.HLP by Oliver Stenzel, available
(in German) from various BBS/mailboxes:

!index database
~## Information about the contents of the  text. (!nl)
~(!XLINK [@database] [hcp] [Command @database]) "LaTeX Help"

!index subject
~## Information about the type of hypertext (!nl)
~(!XLINK [@subject] [hcp] [Command @subject]) "TeX"

!index author
~## Information about the author of the hypertext (!nl)
~(!XLINK [@author] [hcp] [@Command @author]) "Oliver Stenzel"

!index $VER
~## Information about the version of the hypertext (!nl)
~(!XLINK [@$VER:] [hcp] [Command @$VER:]) latex.hyp 1.01 (7/12/92)
