# 1.
!begin_node What's ST-Guide
!html_name stgfaq_1

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] What's ST-Guide?
!item [A:] ST-Guide is a hypertext system with a number of advantages for
   everybody:
!begin_itemize 
!item Programmers: Documentation in hypertext format is read by more
     people than ASCII docs and therefore fewer users will have to
     contact the author with their queries.
!item Programmers: ST-Guide may be distributed with any program, which
     makes it easy to provide on-line help or documents in hypertext
     format for EVERY program without the users first having to bother
     to obtain or pay for the software required for this purpose.
!item Users: The documentation can be read while the program is running.
     It may even be possible for the program itself to make ST-Guide
     display the most important page for each situation ('context
     sensitive').
!item Users: The information needed at any particular time can be found
     faster in a hypertext than in ASCII documents.
!end_itemize
     
 There are certainly
 many other points I could mention but I don't want to boast too
 much!

!begin_node Using 1stGuide & PC_HELP files with ST-Guide
!html_name stgfaq_2

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] I've previously written a 1stGuide format hypertext is it possible
   to use it with ST-Guide?
!item [A:] Several conversion utilities are provided. For 1stGuide format files
   use (!XLINK [1stConv] [1stconv] [Main]), you simply call the main
   file (the one with the table of contents) using the desired
   parameters..
   
   For PureC/PurePascal files a similar utility is available called
   (!XLINK [PC-Conv] [pc_conv] [Main]). You'll also need to use either
   HELP_RC or HELPDISC to re-compile in ST-Guide format. Both are
   included in the STG-UTIL.LZH archive.

!end_blist

!end_node


# 3.
!begin_node Supported file formats
!html_name stgfaq_3

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] Which file formats are supported by ST-Guide?
!item [A:] ST-Guide itself can only display hypertexts (*.HYP) and ASCII texts.
   Hypertexts can in fact contain pictures, which must be available in
   IFF-, ICN- or IMG-format. These are however present directly in the
   hypertext in a special format so that ST-Guide does not contain any
   algorithms for the display of picture files.
   
   It is possible to
   display resource files, or parts of them, from within a hypertext.
   These will only be loaded on request but cannot be displayed
   directly (i.e. without being called from a hypertext).
   
   Equally it's
   possible to send commands from the hypertext to a (or one) running
   application to play music for instance, open an archive, display a
   slide show or similar, but these things are then accomplished by a
   special application and not by ST-Guide.

# 4.
!begin_node Color images
!html_name stgfaq_4

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] I can't see color images in my hypertexts, why not?
!item [A:] Because I haven't implemented color support yet. This will appear
   in the next update. Currently color images can be displayed in
   monochrome.

!end_blist

# 5.
!begin_node Shortcuts inside windows
!html_name stgfaq_5

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] I don't like the predefined keyboard shortcuts in ST-Guide, can I
   change them.
!item [A:] They're coded to conform to the draft version of the gem-list
   standard and are not user definable.

!end_blist

!end_node


# 6.
!begin_node Shortcuts inside dialogs
!html_name stgfaq_6

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] Why don't the ST-Guide dialogs include keyboard shortcuts?
!item [A:] Because I use Let 'em Fly by Oliver Scheel instead.

!end_blist

!end_node


# 7.
!begin_node More file formats!
!html_name stgfaq_7

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] Why doesn't ST-Guide support sound, moving pictures (and my
   coffee machine)?
!item [A:] Not a chance! ST-Guide is designed as a pure hypertext viewer
   and will probably remain so, it largely depends on the level of
   support and (!link [Contributions] [Contributions]) I receive. It's possible I may implement
   support for external viewer modules which would allow ST-Guide
   itself to remain as small as possible.

   It's already possible to display/pass aliased files, so long as
   there's a program which supports the (!XLINK [AV-Protocol] [st-guide] [AV-Protokoll]) and desired
   image format is loaded in memory. ST-Guide can send a message to a
   command line which could in turn be read by the program to display
   the desired file.

!end_blist

!end_node


# 8.
!begin_node Messages to look out for inside the editor
!html_name stgfaq_8

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] How come if I mark a word in the editor and press [Help] no help is
   available?
!item [A:] There are several different reasons which affect how ST-Guide
   responds:
!begin_itemize
   !item ST-Guide makes no response whatsoever (!nl)
      Check whether the program in question supports this feature. If
      necessary rename ST-Guide as Help-ACC and try that:
      !begin_xlist [Everest:] !compressed
      !item [7UP:]     Works in dialogs
      !item [Everest:] Currently only works in the file monitor the next
               version however does work.
      !item [QED:]     Currently only in the file monitor
      !item [Tempus:]  No information
      !item [xEDIT:]   No information
   !end_xlist
   !item ST-Guide alert: "REF-file not found" (!nl)
       In this case the REF-file is not located where the INF file is
       pointing.
       
       Solution: Change the REF-file entry in ST-GUIDE.INF (or move the
                 REF-file where the INF file is pointing).
   !item ST-Guide alert: "<file>.HYP not found" (!nl)
       The REF-file was found, but the hypertext is not located in any
       of the paths specified in the PATHS entry in ST-GUIDE.INF.
       
       Solution: Change the entry in ST-GUIDE.INF or move the HYP file.
   !item ST-Guide alert: "<concept> not found" (!nl)
       The searched concept is not present in the REF-file.
       
       Solution: Use (!XLINK [RefLink] [reflink] [Main]) to add all desired REF-files into the
                 default REF-file.
                 If that doesn't cure the problem you'll have to get
                 hold of a hypertext which contains the desired concept
                 or write your own.

# 9.
!begin_node Where can I get hypertexts?
!html_name stgfaq_9

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] Where can I get ST-Guide format hypertexts?
!item [A:] There are plenty of hypertexts around and they're gradually
   appearing on Internet sites around the world. There's a good
   collection of German hypertexts on the Maus net and a growing
   collection of English language hypertexts on:

!begin_quote
   (!B)micros@hensa.ac.uk(!b)
!end_quote

   These files are available for anonymous ftp and via the WWW (World
   wide web).

# 10.
!begin_node Keyboard selection
!html_name stgfaq_10

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] Where has the keyboard selection gone? I don't want to use the mouse
   for selection, I want the shortcuts back!
!item [A:] The shortcuts are still there, but only appear after using
   [Shift]+[Tab]. Furthermore they automatically deactivate after
   scrolling out of the visible window. This has the advantage that
   scrolling is now smooth, no more judders!

!end_blist

!end_node


# 11.
!begin_node Privilege violation
!html_name stgfaq_11

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] When ST-Guide is called under MultiTOS by another program, a
  'Privilege violation error' is reported. What's that mean?

!item [A:] Under MultiTOS with a suitable CPU optional memory protection can be
   offered to each program. As a default, for instance, only a program
   itself and the AES may read or write to that part of memory reserved
   for a running application. When such a program sends a message to
   ST-Guide, the AES copies from it only the pointers to paths and
   search criteria, but not the strings themselves; this means that the
   memory they occupy belongs to the calling application and even a
   read access by ST-Guide makes MultiTOS register a complaint.

   Solution:
   !begin_enumerate
   !item (Emergency solution): Set the flags of the program (NOT those of
      ST-Guide) to private/readable; a suitable program for this is,
      for instance, GD_FLAGS by Gregor Duchalski.
   !item (Best solution): The calling program should use Mxalloc() with
      corresponding parameters to request memory for the strings to be
      passed.
   !end_enumerate
For more details both solutions refer to the MultiTOS documentation.

# 12.
!begin_node Environmental variables
!html_name stgfaq_12

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] ST-GUIDE will not read my [X]Environmental variables. Why?
!item [A:] This feature has been removed because it caused widespread problems.
   Parameters are now read only from the ST-GUIDE.INF file in the root
   directory of the boot drive.

!end_blist

!end_node


# 13.
!begin_node Calling ST-Guide from inside your own programs
!html_name stgfaq_13

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] Calling ST-Guide via appl_write() from inside my program doesn't
   work?
!item [A:] Although ST-Guide copies the strings passed to it, there's some delay
   between the call and the copying of the parameters. The calling
   program must therefore create the string in such a manner that it
   stays unchanged for a certain time at least. In particular it may not
   be placed on the stack as a local variable. The best solution is to
   use a global array, then it will work.

   (!U)Example ((!XLINK [AV-Protocol] [st-guide] [AV-Protocol])):(!u)

!begin_preformatted
char HelpString[100];

Help(char *pattern)
{
   int msg[8], i;

   if ((i=appl_find("ST-GUIDE"))>=0) {
       msg[0] = VA_START;
       msg[1] = global[2];
       msg[2] = 0;
       sprintf(HelpString, "*:\\MYPROG.HYP %s", pattern);
       *(char **)&msg[3] = HelpString;
       msg[5] = 0;
       msg[6] = 0;
       msg[7] = 0;
       appl_write(i, 16, msg);
   }
}
!end_preformatted

(!U)Example ((!XLINK [PureC-Protocol] [st-guide] [PureC-Protocol])):(!u)

!begin_preformatted
char HelpString[100];

Help(char *pattern)
{
   int msg[8], i;

   if ((i=appl_find("ST-GUIDE"))>=0) {
       msg[0] = AC_HELP;
       msg[1] = global[2];
       msg[2] = 0;
       strcpy(HelpString, Pattern);
       *(char **)&msg[3] = HelpString;
       msg[5] = 0;

!begin_node Calling ST-Guide
!html_name stgfaq_14

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] I use the Atari desktop and have ST-Guide installed as an ACC and
   would like to be able to double click HYP files from the desktop
   and read them in ST-GUIDE, is that possible?
!item [A:] A utility program called CALL-ACC is included in the STG-CONV
   archive which makes this possible. Use the 'Install application'
   option to configure CALL-ACC for *.HYP files and save the desktop.

!item [Q:] That's a lot of trouble! Isn't there an easier way?
!item [A:] Yes, use GEMINI the alternative desktop, which can also install
   ACCs as applications, so no need for CALL-ACC.
   (In GEMINI v1.99 de-select the 'Lower case filenames' option
   otherwise it won't work)!

!begin_node Other questions
!html_name stgfaq_other

If I've not solved your problem yet please get in touch so that I can
improve ST-Guide for the benefit of all users. Please include the
following information:
!begin_enumerate
!item Which version you're using (Contact me or Joe Connor to make sure
   you're using the current version)...
!item With which components the problem manifests itself.
!item How it manifests itself; describe this point as extensively as you
   can. I can't do much with messages like "The converter does not
   translate my text."! The safest method here is to send me a file
   with which I can reproduce the problem. If the HCP contains an
   error, for instance, then an example node that produces this error
   will help me most.
!item In particular when reporting problems using ST-Guide as a desk
   accessory (.ACC), try booting using ST-Guide and no other ACCs and
   Auto folder programs. If the problem goes away try re-installing the
   other ACC's and AUTO-programs one by one in order to try to
   establish which combinations cause the problem. Please contact me
   with the results.

!html_name stgfaq_questions

!subtoc [all] !depth 1


!begin_node How do I write a hypertext?
!html_name stgfaq_question_1

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] How do I write a hypertext?
!item [A:] First of all read the documentation for HCP and ST-Guide. Hypertexts
   are built up using the same principles as used to construct
   programs. You'll need to learn at least a few of the most important
   commands before you'll be able to write your own hypertext. The
   source text must now be written in hypertext format using the
   commands you just learnt and is then compiled into HYP format using
   HCP (Hypertext ComPiler). At this stage you can display your
   creation using ST-Guide.

!begin_node What's the absolute minimum I need to know before writing a hypertext?
!html_name stgfaq_question_2

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] I don't fancy reading that much text, what are bare essentials I
   need to know before I can write a simple hypertext?
!item [A:] The commands (!XLINK [@node] [hcp] [Command @node]), (!XLINK [@endnode] [hcp] [Command @endnode]) and (!XLINK [@symbol] [hcp] [Command @symbol]) will get you started.

   (!U)Example:(!u)

        (!XLINK [##] [hcp] [Commands @remark & ##]) Hypertext header (!nl)
        (!XLINK [@database] [hcp] [Command @database]) <Theme of the hypertext> (!nl)
        (!XLINK [@author] [hcp] [Command @author])   <Name of author, that's you!> (!nl)
        (!XLINK [@subject] [hcp] [Command @subject])  <Where the text should be sorted in the catalogue> (!nl)
        (!XLINK [@$VER:] [hcp] [Command @$VER:])    <Name of file> <Version number> <Creation date>
        
        (!XLINK [##] [hcp] [Commands @remark & ##]) Hypertext pages (!nl)
        (!XLINK [@node] [hcp] [Command @node]) <Page name> [<Window title>] (!nl)
        [(!XLINK [@symbol] [hcp] [Command @symbol]) [flags] <Further names of this page>]

        The body of the hypertext follows here. To reference a
        particular line within the text use (!XLINK [@symbol] [hcp] [Command @symbol])

        (!XLINK [@endnode] [hcp] [Command @endnode])

   During this care must be taken that all arguments (concepts) shown
   here within <> have to be enclosed in inverted commas if they
   contain spaces, e.g. (!XLINK [@node] [hcp] [Command @node]) "foo bar".

   'Concepts' in ST-Guide are words or phrases that will be used to
   create cross-references to other pages of text.

!end_blist

!end_node


!begin_node Node names and the index page
!html_name stgfaq_question_3

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] How can I stop a (!XLINK [@node] [hcp] [Command @node]) or (!XLINK [@pnode] [hcp] [Command @pnode]) from appearing in the Index page?
!item [A:] If the name of the page is preceded by a '%' character it will not
   be included in the index. For example the (!XLINK [@node] [hcp] [Command @node]) "Test" will appear
   in the index but "%Test" will not.
   Such nodes must however currently also be addressed via an explicit
   (!XLINK [link] [hcp] [Command @link]) because the (!XLINK [AutoReferencer] [hcp] [Automatic referencing]) doesn't understand '%'.
   Automatic referencing of nodes is still possible using '(!XLINK [@symbol] [hcp] [Command @symbol]).

!begin_node Lines in text
!html_name stgfaq_question_4

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] I'd like to separate paragraphs in the text with something other by
   lines, '-------------' looks unprofessional, is there an alternative?

!raw [stg] @line 1 66 0 0 7
!raw [stg] ##

!item [A:] Naturally! The (!XLINK [@line] [hcp] [Command @line]) command can draw freely defined lines in
   hypertext pages. It's even possible to use different line patterns
   and arrowheads.

!end_blist

!end_node


!begin_node Every page as a file
!html_name stgfaq_question_5

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] I prefer the method used by (!link [1stGuide] [Using 1stGuide & PC_HELP files with ST-Guide]) where every page is a separate
file.
Is this possible with ST-Guide?
!item [A:] Yes, use the (!XLINK [@include] [hcp] [Command @include]) command.

!end_blist

!end_node

!begin_node Distributed hypertexts
!html_name stgfaq_question_6

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] But this only generates one file per page which means the entire
   file needs to be stored even if only a small part of the text is
   required -and what about separate, but interrelated, files?
!item [A:] Don't worry! The (!XLINK [@uses] [hcp] [Command @uses]) command processes both the HYP
   and REF files to automatically establish comprehensive text
   references.
   (!U)Example:(!u)
        TEXT1.STG contains several pages which should be addressed in
        TEXT2.STG. Write the following in TEXT2.STG:
        "(!XLINK [@uses] [hcp] [Command @uses]) TEXT1.HYP".
        This causes HCP to read all the page names in TEXT1.HYP and
        create any references found automatically.

!end_blist

!end_node


!begin_node ASCII files as references
!html_name stgfaq_question_7

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] Can I use ASCII files (eg C header files) as cross-references?
!item [A:] Yes, for this (and all other cross-references as well) use the
   'link' command, here's an example:
   ... in @{"Standard Header" (!XLINK [link] [hcp] [Command @link]) stdio.h/Main} ...
   Please note the file name must ALWAYS be followed by the name of the
   page to be displayed; since ASCII pages don't possess page names
   'Main' is used as the name here. If something other than 'Main' is
   employed then ST-Guide treats it as a search concept and the first
   line containing the concept will be the first line displayed in the
   window.

!item [Q:] I'd like to build cross-references to ASCII files into my hypertext
   and realise something similar is possible using: (!XLINK [@extern] [hcp] [Command @extern]) and/or
   '@{... (!XLINK [link] [hcp] [Command Command @link]) ...}' The problem is the ASCII files can only be
   displayed from from a given point, i.e. not from the start. Is this
   possible?
!item [A:] Sure. Both with (!XLINK [@extern] [hcp] [Command @extern]) as well as with (!XLINK [link] [hcp] [Command @link]) one can optionally
   include line numbers. These are used by ST-Guide as the number of the
   first line to be displayed.

!item [Q:] Fine, but that still presents a problem: The ASCII files may be
   altered so that the line numbers quoted in the hypertext would no
   longer be correct. Do I therefore have to adapt the hypertext each
   time and translate it anew if one of the ASCII files is changed?
!item [A:] Not necessarily. The text portions to be displayed can also be
   searched for directly and automatically by ST-Guide when the text is
   loaded. This is achieved using:
   @{<text to be clicked on> (!XLINK [link] [hcp] [Command @link]) <ASCII-file>/<page name>}
   If <page name> is NOT 'Main' then it will be searched for in the text
   and the first matching line will become the first line in the window.

!item [Q:] Very nice, but that still leaves one problem: The text passages in my
   ASCII file all occur several times, once at the start in the table of
   contents and then again with the description. If the search is now
   started from the beginning of the text then the 'wrong' occurrence
   will be found every time.
!item [A:] Both (!XLINK [@extern] [hcp] [Command @extern]) as well as (!XLINK [link] [hcp] [Command @link]) can have a line number attached as
   an additional parameter. This will be used as the starting line in
   searching for the concept. So simply input a number that's not too
   far in advance of the desired position and there you have it!

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] With the auto-referencer switched on, is it possible to mask a word
   in a node so that it will not be recognised as a reference?
!item [A:] With (!XLINK [@autorefoff] [hcp] [Command @autorefoff])/(!XLINK [@autorefon] [hcp] [Command @autorefon]) for any desired lines. Example:
     (!XLINK [@autorefoff] [hcp] [Command @autorefoff])
     testtest home is best
     (!XLINK [@autorefon] [hcp] [Command @autorefon])
   Doesn't mark anything in the text line, but does before and after.

   With @{... (!XLINK [ignore] [hcp] [@{ ignore }])} for any desired part of lines. Example:
     testtest @{"nix" (!XLINK [ignore] [hcp] [@{ ignore }])} is best
   Doesn't make a cross-reference of <home> even if there is an
   alias/node/symbol with this name.

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] That's well and good but I have a couple of pages in my text whose
   names appear very frequently in different nodes and these ideally
   shouldn't be automatically referenced for every occurrence, is there
   an alternative?
!item [A:] The (!XLINK [@noref] [hcp] [Command @noref]) command is designed specifically for this eventuality.
   Nodes within this command are not automatically referenced but
   can still be explicitly referenced using the @{... (!XLINK [link] [hcp] [Command @link]) ...} command.

!begin_node Why are the 'next' & 'previous' pages not selectable?
!html_name stgfaq_question_10

!begin_blist [Q:]

!item [Q:] I'd like to set the order my pages are read, how do I do this?
!item [A:] Here are the commands:
   (!XLINK [@prev] [hcp] [Command @prev]) :determines which page "Page <" displays
   (!XLINK [@next] [hcp] [Command @next]) :determines which page "Page >" displays
   (!XLINK [@toc] [hcp] [Command @toc]) :determines which page "Contents" displays

   If the current page matches any of the above parameters then the
   corresponding button will not be selectable.

   If (!XLINK [@next] [hcp] [Command @next]) or (!XLINK [@prev] [hcp] [Command @prev]) is not set for a page then the actual following
   or previous page is referenced. If (!XLINK [@toc] [hcp] [Command @toc]) is not set the first page of
   the text is referenced.

   These commands make it possible to create, for example, for a
   herarchical table of contents.
   In such a structure, for example, the "Page >" button could be
   disabled even though further pages exist. HCP still automatically
   checks these pages and adds corresponding entries in the Index page.
   This has been used in this hypertext to start each new question from
   authors entry on a new page.
